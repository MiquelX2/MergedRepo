JavaFrameBuffer
===============

Acces to Linux frame buffer devices from Java. E.g. for driving LCD SPI displays on the Raspberry Pi

See the run.sh script for setting up the LD_LIBRARY path for the JNI part and the example test class.

I didn't make a jar for on file, so you have to copy the Java file and the JNI to your Java project.

If someone can compile the Windows JNI parts, please send me the script and the library, I will add it :-)
